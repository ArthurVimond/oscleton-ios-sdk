/**
 The main entry point to use Oscleton SDK.
 
 This singleton provides multiple features splitted in different classes:
 - [OSConfiguration](../OSConfiguration) is responsible for the settings needed to establish the connection.
 - [OSController](../OSController) lets you control a Live set from your iOS device.
 - [OSReceiver](../OSReceiver) lets you receive Live set events in real time on your iOS device.
